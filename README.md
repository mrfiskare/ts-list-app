# TypeScript List Application ðŸ“‹

## About this project

### Description

I created this project to learn more about vanilla TypeScript. The code closely follows
[Dave Gray's](https://github.com/gitdagray) great course called
[TypeScript Project from Scratch](https://youtu.be/61v23Ce5SXA?si=_E8w379ge7it0jLx).

### Requirements

| Name       | Version |
|------------|---------|
| Node.js    | 20.8.0  |
| npm        | 10.2.0  |
| TypeScript | 5.3.3   |

### Generating TypeScript project

For generating a vanilla TypeScript project a tool called Vite can be used. It does the
scaffolding automatically using via the following terminal command:

```shell
npm create vite@latest
```

## Using Prettier on the project

### What is Prettier?

Prettier is an opinionated code formatter tool. It's pretty handy when it comes to
collaboration between developers.

### How to use Prettier with WebStorm on Mac

* Install Prettier with npm
* Webstorm Settings â†’ Languages & Frameworks â†’ JavaScript â†’
    1. Enable Prettier
    2. Enable _On 'Reformat Code' action_
    3. Enable _On save_

### Debugging Prettier with WebStorm on Mac

If, for some reason, Prettier doesn't work automatically on save, open the project in the Terminal and
try debugging Prettier with `prettier . --write`.

In my case, enabling the On save feature didn't work at all,
so I had to do this additional step:

Webstorm Settings â†’ Tools â†’ Actions on save â†’ Tick _Reformat Code_

This should fix the problem of Prettier not running on save.

## Singleton design pattern

### What is the Singleton pattern?

The Singleton pattern restricts the instantiation of a class to one 'single' instance. This is useful
when exactly one object is needed.

In this project's case, only one `FullList` object can be created. This ensures the consistency of data
across the application.

### Major takeaways with Singletons

* A Singleton class should have a `static instance` field.
* A Singleton's constructor should always be private to prevent direct construction calls with the `new` operator.
* A Singleton class should provide a `static` method to access the single instance.

  <summary>Example: Singleton class with a static instance field</summary>

```typescript
// @formatter:off

export default class FullList implements List {
  static instance: FullList = new FullList();

  private constructor(
    private _list: ListItem[] = []
  ) {
  }
}

// @formatter:on
```

With this approach, you'd access the single instance by directly referencing the `instance` field:

```typescript
FullList.instance.load();
```

Here, `FullList.instance` refers to the single instance of `FullList`, and you're calling the `load()`
method on that instance. The key point is that the constructor of `FullList` is private.

  <summary>Example: Singleton class with a static method</summary>

```typescript
// @formatter:off

export default class FullList implements List {
  private static _instance: FullList;

  private constructor(
    private _list: ListItem[] = []
  ) {
  }

  public static getInstance(): FullList {
    if (!FullList._instance) {
      FullList._instance = new FullList();
    }
    return FullList._instance;
  }
}

// @formatter:on
```

With this approach, you'd access the single instance using a static method `getInstance()`:

```typescript
const myListInstance = FullList.getInstance();
myListInstance.load();
```

</details>

## TypeScript parameter properties

### Description

In TypeScript when you declare a constructor parameter with an access modifier (such as `private` or `public`),
TypeScript implicitly creates a class member with that name and assigns the value of the parameter to it.
This shorthand notation saves you from explicitly declaring the member separately, reducing the boilerplate code.

## Arrow Functions / Lambda Expressions

### Description

Fat arrow `=>` notations are used for **anonymous functions**. With this syntax there's need to use the
function keyword.

They provide a more compact syntax compared to traditional function expressions and offer some additional
benefits, particularly regarding the handling of the `this` keyword.

### Basic Syntax:

The basic syntax of an arrow function is `(parameters) => { statements }`. If the function has only
one statement, you can omit the curly braces and the return keyword.

For example:

```typescript
// Arrow function with no parameters
const greet = () => {
  console.log("Hello!");
};

// Arrow function with one parameter
const square = (x: number) => {
  return x * x;
};

// Arrow function with multiple parameters
const add = (a: number, b: number) => {
  return a + b;
};
```

### Implicit return

If the function body consists of only one expression, you can omit the curly braces and
the return keyword. The value of that expression will be implicitly returned.

For example:

```typescript
// Implicit return
const double = (x: number) => x * 2;
```

### No `this` Binding

Arrow functions do not have their own `this` context. Instead, they inherit the `this` value
from the surrounding lexical context. This behavior can be particularly useful when dealing with event
handlers or callback functions where the context of `this` needs to be preserved.

For example:

```typescript
class MyClass {
  constructor(private value: number) {
  }

  regularFunction() {
    console.log("Regular function:", this.value);
  }

  arrowFunction = () => {
    console.log("Arrow function:", this.value);
  };
}

const obj = new MyClass(42);
const regularFunc = obj.regularFunction;
const arrowFunc = obj.arrowFunction;

regularFunc(); // Output: Regular function: undefined (in strict mode) or 42 (in non-strict mode)
arrowFunc();   // Output: Arrow function: 42
```

## Ternary Statements

### Description

Ternary statements, also known as the conditional operator `? :`, provide a concise way to
write conditional expressions in TypeScript (and JavaScript).

### Syntax

The syntax of a ternary statement is `condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse`.

### Readability

Ternary statements can make code more readable when used appropriately, particularly for short and
straightforward conditions.

### Nested Ternaries

While ternary statements can improve code readability for simple conditions, nesting
them too deeply can reduce readability and maintainability. It's generally recommended to use `if...else`
statements for more complex logic.

## Rendering the list to the DOM

### Description

First, we clear the DOM, then we create the HTML elements (`li`, `checkbox`) using a
`FullList` typed object. This object implements the `List` interface, thus it has a
`ListItem` array that we can work with.

### Dynamic HTML list item element creation

This code can be found in `src/templates/ListTemplate.ts`. The generated `li` elements
will be placed into an `ul` element of the DOM that has the id of `listItems`.

```ts
// @formatter:off

render(fullList: FullList) {
  this.clear();
  fullList.list.forEach((item) => {
    const li = document.createElement('li') as HTMLLIElement;
    li.className = 'item';

    const check = document.createElement('input') as HTMLInputElement;
    check.type = 'checkbox';
    check.id = item.id;
    check.checked = item.checked;
    li.append(check);
  });
}

// @formatter:on
```

This is how a generated `li` element would look like in the DOM:

```html

<li class='item'>
  <input type='checkbox' id='1'>
  <label for='1'>eat</label>
  <button class='button'>X</button>
</li>
```
